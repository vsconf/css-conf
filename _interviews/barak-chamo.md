__[Q] Is this your first trip to Melbourne? Or Australia? Do you have other plans for your trip?__

It is! I'm really excited to finally visit Melbourne. I hear Melbourne is both the happiest city and has some of the best cafes (I'm sure there's a connection) so I'm just looking forward to soaking up the city and the smell of roasted beans.

__[Q] Have you ever feared for your life while on vacation?__

Once, going up a mountain in New Zealand's South Island with an ill-suited junker.

About half way up the winding road I noticed the climb kept getting ever steeper and I started to skid on the gravel - I was sure I was going to meet my maker in a glorious ball of rust and flames(!)

I ended just slowly backtracking and was fine, yet drenched in sweat, back at the foot of the mountain.

__[Q] If money and time was no object, what would you be doing right now?__

Living [here, in Kakslauttanen](http://kakslauttanen.fi), and traveling all the time - wanderlust is probably my strongest driving force and there's nothing I enjoy more than discovering new places (Melbourne included!). And once I covered the Earth? I'll just go again in the other direction!

__[Q] Tell us about the journey that led you to what you're doing.__

I was in my senior year in college studying finance, and an entrepreneurship professor approached me asking if I'd be interested in a job at a startup - I was extremely bored with my major at the time and was really excited by the startup world so I jumped on the opportunity without knowing much about the web. I had to learn a lot, fast - but I loved the ability to make things, to innovate and to do so fast.

I've been learning constantly ever since, experimenting with new technologies and expanding my knowledge. I'm really excited about the direction the web is going in. We're miles ahead from where we were just a few years a go and I'm looking forward to see what's next.

__[Q] What can't you wait for browsers to support?__

The Houdini spec! OMG! Come to my talk and you'll know why ;)
