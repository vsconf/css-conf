__[Q] What would you do if you did not have to work?__

I think I’d still want to be a programmer even if I didn’t need the income. The web is such an exciting place to work; I’d miss my peers and the challenges of development too much to quit. But if I could help it, I’d definitely do less client work and spend more time on cause-based projects: I’m especially interested in teaching programming to high-school kids, helping ministries use modern web tools, and creating financial systems to serve the under-banked and improve financial literacy among the poor.

__[Q] What was the best non-tech job you have ever had?__

I worked one summer in a century-old hat shop, selling, restoring and maintaining cowboy hats. I’m a total romantic, and spending the summer in that workshop, steeping in the history and tradition of the place, made for one of the most peaceful seasons of my memory.

__[Q] Who in the industry consistently blows you away with incredible work?__

Derek Nelson [www.dereknelson.me](http://www.dereknelson.me/ "Derek Nelson's Website") at Zaengle, and Bill Kenney at Focus Lab: Their design work consistently inspires me both aesthetically and in terms of the ambition I have about where the status quo of web development should be. Also, the Craft CMS team, especially Brandon Kelly, the founder: Studying how they run their business and interact with customers is a constant lesson in thoughtfulness and intentionality. They inspire me to level-up as a business owner to better serve my team.

__[Q] Do you skydive, knit, play the banjo, cycle or do anything that isn’t on a computer?__

I try to spend as little time staring at screens as I can manage. I enjoy cooking, dancing (especially swing and country-western), and working out with the circus (trapeze is my favorite).

__[Q] Do your dream job 10 years from now, what would it be?__

I figure whatever job I’ll want in 10 years probably doesn’t exist yet. Maybe something ministry-related; I think sometimes I’d make a decent priest. I’d also like to get into the space industry somehow. When SpaceX starts flying people to Mars, they’ll need programming aerialist astronaut priests… right?
