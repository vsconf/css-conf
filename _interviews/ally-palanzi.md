__[Q] Is this your first trip to Melbourne? Or Australia? Do you have other plans for your trip?__

Yes! This is my first trip. I’m looking forward to staying the week and hopefully getting a chance to explore. All tips and suggestions are welcome. I wish I could stay longer!

__[Q] Who in the industry consistently blows you away with incredible work?__

Una Kravets [@una](https://www.twitter.com/una "una on Twitter") is constantly doing amazing work all while traveling the world. She’s one of my closest friends and also a huge inspiration.

__[Q] What is your worst travel experience?__

A few years ago, I was traveling with a friend to Rome. We were staying in an Airbnb and didn’t realize the host had also rented out another room in the apartment. Late at night, we heard someone coming into the apartment, and had no idea what to do. We didn’t have working cell phones so couldn't call anyone. Eventually, we came out of our room to see what was up and it turned out to be a really friendly Parisian couple.

__[Q] What would you do if you did not have to work?__

Playing all of the video games I wish I had time to play and travel a lot!

__[Q] What's your favourite [css property / npm package]?__

Right now I’m really obsessed with @supports in CSS.
