A moment with Nadieh Bremer
======

__[Q] Do you sky-dive, knit, play the banjo, cycle or do anything that isn't on a computer?__
Although I'm spending practically all my free time on personal or weird data visualization experiments, when I have any time left I do like to work with paper in an origami kind of way. I've folded several lamp shades because we couldn't find anything we liked that was affordable. Due to having a cat I've folded flowers and cranes that I've placed on metal wires, at least those she won't eat. But recently I've grown to love making Kusudama, which are modular pieces that eventually form fantastic spheres of folded shapes.

__[Q] If money and time were no object, what would you be doing right now?__
I would be traveling, but in a bit of luxury. I'm too much of a control freak to enjoy backpacking (and not knowing where you might sleep that night), but I love to see the world. Especially its nature and animals. With time and money not being an issue I would book trip after trip. Eco friendly resorts in Africa, surfing hotels in Indonesia, hiking in Iceland, 3 months touring through New Zealand in a camper, I can go on and on.

__[Q] Tell us about the journey that led you to what you're doing.__
Ever since I did a presentation on the Solar System in school when I was 10 years old, I was hooked on the stars, so my choice for University was clear: Astronomy. However, after 5 years of studying the stars I knew I didn't want to do a PhD. I loved the research but hated the writing and I wanted to do something more dynamic, more tangible. So I left Academia and joined the analytics department of Deloitte consulting to become a Data Scientist. It was here that I, almost unconsciously, started to find out that even though I loved doing analytics, I loved the visualization of the data or insights found even more. I could spend hours perfecting a graph, whereas my enthusiasm for improving an analytical model was there, but less than for doing the visualization. Then in November 2014 I went to a Strata Conference in Barcelona, where I watched a great talk by Mike Freeman on data visualization. I still remember very clearly the moment where it hit me. Mike called himself a "Data Visualization Specialist" on his starting slide. I didn't even know that existed! But I knew immediately that I wanted to be able to name myself that one day as well. And from that day on I finally consciously started to focus on data visualization. Now, 2 years later, I'm working as a full-time data visualization designer at Adyen, which is a financial technology company based in Amsterdam, doing what I love all day and continuing on personal data visualization experiments in my evenings and weekends for my website VisualCinnamon.

__[Q] If you could have any question answered, what would it be?__
The first thing that came to mind was "What is the basic building block of life for other alien species? On Earth we have DNA, but what other fundamental blocks can produce life as well, if any? (and how does that affect appearance, senses, species?)". Maybe not the most useful question, but I firmly believe that some form of alien life is out there (although not relatively close to us) so it is something that intrigues me. In a weird sense I feel that "theoretically" it could be answered, we "only" have such a vast expanse of space between us and them that prevents us from observing them :)

__[Q] Who should we be following on Twitter?__
The data visualization community definitely lives on Twitter, so if you want to see more about it follow people such as [@visualoop](https://www.twitter.com/visualoop "visualoop on Twitter"), [@albertocairo](https://www.twitter.com/albertocairo "albertocairo on Twitter"), [@visualisingdata](https://www.twitter.com/visualisingdata "visualisingdata on Twitter"), [@micahstubbs](https://www.twitter.com/micahstubbs "micahstubbs on Twitter"), [@nytgraphics](https://www.twitter.com/nytgraphics "nytgraphics on Twitter"), [@janwillemtulp](https://www.twitter.com/janwillemtulp "janwillemtulp on Twitter"), [@dashingd3js](https://www.twitter.com/dashingd3js "dashingd3js on Twitter"), or [@flowingdata](https://www.twitter.com/flowingdata "flowingdata on Twitter")
