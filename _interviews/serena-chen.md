__[Q] Tell us a bit about yourself and what you do.?__

Hello! I'm a designer at BNZ Digital. In my spare time I run a [podcast](http://thingsofinterest.co "Things of Interest"), [dabble](https://github.com/heisenburger "heisenburger on Twitter") in open source projects, and nerd out about maths, security, feminism, and politics.

I'm currently mainlining Star Trek: Voyager, and loving every minute of it.

__[Q] Tell us about the journey that led you to what you're doing.__

It wasn’t planned, that’s for sure!

My formal training is nowhere near design or programming, but in physics and math. I was considering which project to take up for a Masters/PhD when I went through a bit of a Tough Time™. Even though I graduated with First Class Honours, I was convinced that I was an imposter, faking my way through. Embarrassing myself by being around Real Scientists.

Almost as a distraction from my science identity crisis, I had begun to work on an idea with a couple of friends. It’d be an [online magazine for teen girls](http://hvngry.com) — one that respected their intelligence and welcomed intersectionality. I then designed and built the website that, essentially, launched my career.

But it's not like I was suddenly good at websites. That story starts a litter earlier.

When I was 6, our family immigrated from China to New Zealand. My dad used to go to the local dump to buy old computers; he’d bring them back, fix them, refurbish them, and sell them from our garage. This meant that our household was surprisingly hi-tech. We had an internet connection, and I was exposed to the early Internet (spelt with a capital ‘I’ back then). By the time I was 10, I was building websites for fun. Making livejournal themes, building fansites and uploading them to places like *angelfire* and *tripod*. And don't get me wrong -- I wasn't some kind of internet kid genius. These sites that I built were terribad. So, so ugly. But I loved it. And I kept it as a hobby throughout my teen years.

This is something I like to tell budding web designers and developers: don't get caught up in the formalities of learning. Take an evening, or a weekend, and just make something. Have fun with it. Sometimes the best motivator is good ol' fashioned boredom.

__[Q] What is a hidden talent you have?__

I'm reasonably good at foosball. Abysmal at any actual sport, but okay at foosball! Let's have a game sometime.

__[Q] Who in the industry consistently blows you away with incredible work?__

I am a fan of so many people and their work I'm not sure where to start. Just in the web community I have to give shoutouts to [Nicole Sullivan](https://twitter.com/stubbornella), [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons), [Alisha Ramos](https://twitter.com/alishalisha), [Diana Mounter](https://twitter.com/broccolini), [Lea Verou](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou), [Adam Morse](https://twitter.com/mrmrs_), [Adrienne Porter Felt](https://twitter.com/__apf__), and others. Their work has not only been influential, but have often challenged my ingrained ways of thinking.

__[Q] Tabs or Spaces?__

Either as long as it's consistent?

(But spaces, right. Spaces.)
