__[Q] What was the best non-tech job you have ever had?__

Kids' party host at an indoor playground. I learnt to make chocolate crackles and balloon animals, and I could go for a swim in the ball pit whenever I felt the need (which was all the time).

__[Q] What two things do you consider yourself to be very good at?__

Untangling knots and mixing mojitos.

__[Q] What is the weirdest thing you have ever eaten on a vacation?__

On a recent trip to Morocco I ate snails from a vendor at the markets. I won't lie, the texture was a bit odd but after a few of the little slimy suckers I was hooked. They're cooked in a flavourful broth and are so fresh I couldn't help but go back for more. I wasn't brave enough to try the sheep's head, but it's on my list of things to do when I get the courage.

__[Q] Tabs or Spaces?__

Either - I don't feel strongly either way as long as you pick one and stick with it. Seeing inconsistent indenting in code makes me twitch.

__[Q] If you didn't work on the web, what would you be doing?__

Something food related, probably. If not cooking it, then definitely eating it.
