__[Q] Where do you aspire to get to from here?__

It's hard to picture being happier job-wise. I still have plenty to work towards, but my main aspirations are about the kind of person I want to be, rather than any particular job or expertise.

Picasso said "it has taken me my whole life to learn to draw like a child" and I feel like that sums up a lot of what I'm after. If I can find simple joy in making things, and help others to do the same, I'll know I've done something special with my time.

__[Q] What was the best non-tech job you have ever had?__

This would have to be a holiday job I had as a teenager, working for a landscape architect. He drew up plans by hand and it was my job to colour them in with pencils. Interestingly, he was colour-blind and so selected all of the colours by their number.

__[Q] Of all the places you have lived/visited, what was the one you like the best? Why?__

My wife & I lived in Cambodia for 6 months, and the thing that stuck with me the most was the way the community involved themselves in each others' lives. We missed it when returning to a world where people are often polite to the point of being cold.

This was also a cross-roads in my career, where I had my first experience of being a remote developer and shortly after was offered a job at X-Team. It's now my privilege to help others around the world do the same.

__[Q] Tell us about the journey that led you to what you're doing?__

When I started thinking seriously about a career, the idea of being a web developer couldn't have been less appealing. As far as I thought it was a slower, worse-looking, clunkier expression of what a computer could be.

But halfway through university I saw an aspect of the web that somehow I had never seen before: I saw people publishing, collaborating, and connecting. From this point on I was fascinated with the web and all of the unusual human interactions and empowerment it can lead to.

__[Q] What is the most exciting development on the web in the last year?__

Earlier this year at CampJS I was introduced to patchwork, a peer-to-peer social network. This is exciting for the web, for the new patterns it might inspire and the old problems solved in new ways.

The other aspect I like about patchwork is that it signifies a rising number of people working to make this kind of tech accessible to the masses. ferment is one such example, which uses the same underlying parts to make an audio publishing platform similar to SoundCloud.
