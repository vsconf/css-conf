__[Q] Is this your first trip to Melbourne? Or Australia? Do you have other plans for your trip?__
Yes, it's my first trip to Australia and I'm looking forward to it. I have also read great things about Melbourne and its quality of life.
When visiting new cities, I like walking around their streets, looking for things that are different to what I'm used to. For instance, a visit to a supermarket can teach you a lot about the culture and gastronomy of a place.

__[Q] Who in the industry consistently blows you away with incredible work?__
There are many great people I appreciate in the web community. I'm always amazed by Lea Verou, Paul Lewis, Dan Abramov, Ricardo Cabello, Scott Jehl and John Resig. They are constantly pushing the web forward and are a great source of inspiration.

__[Q] Have you worked in industries other than the Web?__
I used to work with my father during school holidays. He is an electrician and I helped with the wiring and connecting lamps and sockets. If the job was too hard I would stay at our small shop organizing our stock, reviewing deliveries from our suppliers, answering calls from customers and invoicing. It felt good contributing to the family business.

__[Q] What was the worst production incident that you caused?__
I have brought a couple of sites down. And one of them was during my first week on the job, which made me feel quite embarrassed. Fortunately it lasted only a few minutes.
I believe incidents should be seen as learning opportunities to make systems and processes better, and every cloud has a silver lining.

__[Q] What is the most interesting thing you've learned about CSS/JavaScript in the last year?__
I find it interesting how we are finding better ways of writing CSS and JS in a more modular way, thinking about components and how they fit together to create rich client-side applications. And even more important, how data is fetched and how it flows between those components.

I have started playing with async/await and generators, and I believe they are going to suppose another big change when reasoning about asynchronous code.
